                    or in other words, it is a supply chain system that will always be up to date and only certain
                    employees have access, in accordance with regulations.

                    Warehouse is an integral part of the modern supply chain that involves the process of sourcing,
                    producing, and distributing goods or products. Starting from raw materials, processing semi-finished
                    products to finished products..</p>

                <p class="margin-top-10">To coordinate the distribution of goods resulting from the imbalance between
                    supply and demand, a warehouse will be very important. Inventories of these goods require space such
                    as temporary storage facilities called warehouses.

                    In managing warehouse management, there are several principles, namely the speed of market delivery
                    and meeting demand, accuracy in running the supply chain continuously, customers can get products
                    easily and quickly, getting information related to inventory in the warehouse is easier.</p>

                <p class="margin-top-10">Warehouse Function
                    stock inventory management software
                    Warehouse has a function other than as a place to store goods but also has several other functions.
                    There are four warehouse functions, namely:</p>
                <p>
                    1. Goods Storage
                    The main function of the warehouse is as a place to store goods. In storing goods, it must be neat
                    and according to the plan so that in the retrieval process there is no confusion, especially in
                    warehouses that accommodate a lot of goods.</p>
                <p>
                    2. As Product Safety
                    Furthermore, as a security for inventory or goods sent, and orders to remain intact they can be
                    reused. The function of the warehouse is not only in terms of theft prevention but disaster
                    mitigation.</p>
                <p>
                    3. As a Packaging Maker
                    The third function is as a packing builder, the company will use the warehouse as an assembly
                    facility or a place for packing and bundling. Semi-finished goods or products can be perfected in
                    the warehouse and then sent to customers.</p>
                <p>
                    4. To Increase Inventory and Re-Order
                    One of the difficulties in managing the warehouse is determining the time to reorder goods because
                    the available stock of goods is in various warehouse locations.</p>

            <div class="block">
                <p><span class="first-character atw">M</span>ethod of Storage of Goods in Warehouse
                    You can do storage in the warehouse in five ways, as follows: 1. Dedicated storage
                    The first way to store goods in the warehouse is the dedicated storage or fixed location method.
                    This method of storing goods in the warehouse means that each product has a fixed place or location
                    in storage in the warehouse. The location cannot be changed or used by other types of products even
                    if there is an empty space.</p>
                <p>
                    2. Randomized Storage
                    Second, there is a method of randomized storage or floating lot storage, which is a way of storing
                    goods which is the opposite of the dedicated storage method. The randomized storage method means
                    that storage in the warehouse can be done randomly. Goods or products may experience a change of
                    storage location. Storage can also be done in any place possible.</p>
                <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
                <p class="margin-top-10">3. Class-based storage
                    Third, the method of storing goods in the next warehouse is the class based storage method. This
                    method is a combined method of dedicated storage and randomized storage. The class-based storage
                    method is to arrange the location of the storage of goods in the warehouse more flexibly but still
                    neatly.</p>
                <p>
                    4. Shared storage
                    Fourth, the use of the shared storage method, which is a method of storing goods in the warehouse
                    which aims to reduce the need for storage space for goods. The shared storage method prioritizes the
                    advantage of differences in the storage time of goods in the warehouse. In this method it is
                    important to determine the items carefully based on the storage space.</p>
                <p>
                    5. Cube per order index policy
                    Finally, there is a method of storing goods in the last warehouse, which is the cube per order index
                    policy. The cube per order index policy method is a way of storing goods in the warehouse by paying
                    attention to the level of storage space requirements in the warehouse with the number of product
                    transactions. The cube per order index policy method means setting product locations based on
                    product categories and product movement distances..</p>
